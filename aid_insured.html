      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>The line graphs provide a visual representation of the trends in aid costs and insured damage costs over time, broken down by disaster type. The x-axis represents years, while the y-axis shows monetary values in thousands of U.S. dollars. The graph includes two separate lines for each disaster type: one for aid contributions and another for insured damage (adjusted). Different colors are used to distinguish disaster types, facilitating a comparative view of how aid and reconstruction costs fluctuate across different disaster types and time periods.</p>
