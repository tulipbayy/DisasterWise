<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interactive-world-map---frequency-of-disaster-type">Interactive World Map - Frequency of Disaster Type</h2>
<p>This interactive map visualizes global disaster events by location and type. Each marker represents a disaster, with popups showing details like disaster type, year, location, and the total affected population. Clustered markers simplify dense areas, helping users explore disaster patterns and identify high-risk regions worldwide. This tool offers a quick overview of global disaster impacts and frequency.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economic-damage-by-type-and-region">Economic Damage by Type and Region</h2>
<p>This world map heatmap visualizes economic damage from disasters, highlighting regions with low (blue) to high (red) impact. Each point’s intensity is based on the economic damage caused by disaster events, making areas with higher damage more prominent. The simplified color scheme emphasizes major impact zones, helping to identify regions most affected by costly disasters at a glance. This map offers a clear, comparative view of economic vulnerability to disasters worldwide, aiding in risk assessment and resource allocation for disaster preparedness and recovery.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disaster-response-effectiveness">Disaster Response Effectiveness</h2>
<p>This bar chart illustrates the effectiveness of disaster response efforts, measured by the total number of deaths, across different disaster types. Each bar represents a specific disaster type, such as floods, earthquakes, or wildfires, with colors indicating the type of response intervention by OFDA/BHA (Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance/Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance) or an appeal for international aid. The chart compares the mortality impact of each disaster type under different response statuses, allowing viewers to observe which responses may be associated with lower or higher fatalities.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trends-in-aid-and-insured-damage-adjusted-over-time">Trends in Aid and Insured Damage Adjusted over Time</h2>
<p>The line graph provides a visual representation of the trends in aid costs and insured damage costs over time, broken down by disaster type. The x-axis represents years, while the y-axis shows monetary values in thousands of U.S. dollars. The graph includes two separate lines for each disaster type: one for aid contributions and another for insured damage (adjusted). Different colors are used to distinguish disaster types, facilitating a comparative view of how aid and reconstruction costs fluctuate across different disaster types and time periods.</p>
