      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This bar chart illustrates the effectiveness of disaster response efforts, measured by the total number of deaths, across different disaster types. Each bar represents a specific disaster type, such as floods, earthquakes, or wildfires, with colors indicating the type of response intervention by OFDA/BHA (Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance/Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance) or an appeal for international aid. The chart compares the mortality impact of each disaster type under different response statuses, allowing viewers to observe which responses may be associated with lower or higher fatalities.</p>
